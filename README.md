# ROTO-R-Workshop-Aug-2023
### Tutorial for getting set up with R / RStudio, learning coding fundamentals and basic data analysis!


* To get started, I reccomend downloading the folder called "workshop" to your personal computer
* Then, open the file "ROTO Before the workshop guide.pdf" for instructions on how to install R and RStudio - or alternatively how to use RStudio via the web
* This pre-worshop PDF also breifly describes how to use and nagvigate the RStudio interface
* Lastly the PDF outlines what to expect in each section of the workshop
